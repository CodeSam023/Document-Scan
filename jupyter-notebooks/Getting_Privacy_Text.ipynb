Data We Collect 1.1 Data You Provide To Us\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou provide data to create an account with us.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nRegistration To create an account you need to provide data including your name, email address and/or mobile number, and a password. If you register for a premium Service, you will need to provide payment (e.g., credit card) and billing information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou create your LinkedIn profile (a complete profile helps you get the most from our Services).\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nProfile You have\\xa0choices\\xa0about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo,\\xa0city or area\\xa0and endorsements. Some Members may choose to complete a separate\\xa0ProFinder\\xa0profile.

It’s your choice whether to include\\xa0sensitive information\\xa0on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou give other data to us, such as by syncing your address book or calendar.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nPosting and Uploading We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a form, (e.g., with demographic data or\\xa0salary), respond to a survey, or submit a resume or fill out a job application on our Services. If you opt to import your address book, we receive your contacts (including contact information your service provider(s) or app automatically added to your address book when you communicated with addresses or numbers not already in your list). If you sync your contacts or calendars with our Services, we will collect your address book and calendar meeting information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others, and by providing information about events, e.g. times, places, attendees and contacts.

If you or others opt-in to sync email accounts with our Services, we will also collect “email header” information that we can associate with Member profiles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCustomers and partners may provide data to us.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nPartners We receive personal data (e.g., your job title and work email address) about you when you use the services of our customers and partners, such as employers or prospective employers and applicant tracking systems providing us job application data.

You can opt out from our use of data from cookies and similar technologies that track your behavior on the sites of others for ad targeting and other ad-related purposes. For Visitors, the controls are here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.5 Your Device and Location\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe receive data through cookies and similar technologies\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWhen you visit or leave our Services (including some plugins and our cookies or similar technology on the sites of others), we receive the URL of both the site you came from and the one you go to and the time of your visit.

For example, if you get a LinkedIn connection request, we track whether you have acted on it and will send you reminders. We also use\\xa0automatic scanning\\xa0technology on messages to support and protect our site. For example, we use this technology to suggest possible responses to messages and to manage or block content that violates our User Agreement or\\xa0Professional Community Policies\\xa0from our Services. 1.7 Workplace and School Provided Information\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen your organization (e.g., employer or school) buys a premium Service for you to use, they give us data about you.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nOthers buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni. For example, we will get contact information for “Company Page” administrators and for authorizing users of our premium Services, such as our recruiting, sales or learning products. 1.8 Sites and Services of Others\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe get data when you visit sites that include our ads, cookies or some of our plugins or when you log-in to others’ services with your LinkedIn account.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe receive information about your visits and interaction with services provided by others when you log-in with LinkedIn or visit others’ services that include some of our plugins (such as “Apply with LinkedIn”) or our ads, cookies or similar technologies. 1.9 Other\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are improving our Services, which means we get new data and create new ways to use data.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nOur Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we collect, use or share your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          Key Terms\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAffiliates Affiliates are companies controlling, controlled by or under common control with us, including, for example, LinkedIn Ireland, LinkedIn Corporation, LinkedIn Singapore and Microsoft Corporation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2. How We Use Your Data\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe use your data to provide, support, personalize and develop our Services.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nHow we use your personal data will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your\\xa0settings. We use the data that we have about you to provide and personalize our Services, including with the help of automated systems and inferences we make, so that our Services (including ads) can be more relevant and useful to you and others. 2.1 Services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOur Services help you connect with others, find and be found for work and business opportunities, stay informed, get training and be more productive.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings. Stay Connected Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can “connect” with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to “connect” with you. Subject to your and their\\xa0settings, when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others’ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities. We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other\\xa0nearby\\xa0Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event). It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can\\xa0choose\\xa0whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections. Visitors have\\xa0choices\\xa0about how we use their data. Stay Informed Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your\\xa0settings, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a\\xa0social action, used a feature, made new connections or were\\xa0mentioned in the news. Career Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a\\xa0specific task) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs or mentees, show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are\\xa0interested\\xa0in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services. Productivity Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your\\xa0settings\\xa0allow, we scan messages to provide “bots” or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps.\\xa0Learn more. 2.2 Premium Services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOur premium Services help paying users to search for and contact Members through our Services, such as searching for and contacting job candidates, sales leads and co-workers, manage talent and promote content through social media.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe sell premium Services that provide our customers and subscribers with customized-search functionality and tools (including messaging and activity alerts) as part of our talent, marketing and sales solutions. Customers can export limited information from your profile, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and general location (e.g., Dublin), such as to manage sales leads or talent, unless you\\xa0opt-out. We do not provide contact information to customers as part of these premium Services without your consent. Premium Services customers can store information they have about you in our premium Services, such as a resume or contact information or sales history. The data stored about you by these customers is subject to the policies of those customers. Other enterprise Services and features that use your data include\\xa0TeamLink\\xa0and\\xa0Elevate\\xa0(social promotion of content). 2.3 Communications\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe contact you and enable communications between Members. We offer settings to control what messages you receive and how often you receive some types of messages.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also send messages about how to use our Services, network updates, reminders, job suggestions and promotional messages from us and our partners. You may change your communication\\xa0preferences\\xa0at any time. Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from us, including security and legal notices. We also enable\\xa0communications\\xa0between you and others through our Services, including for example\\xa0invitations,\\xa0InMail,\\xa0groups\\xa0and\\xa0messages\\xa0between connections. 2.4 Advertising\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe serve you tailored ads both on and off our Services. We offer you choices regarding personalized ads, but you cannot opt-out of seeing other ads.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of\\xa0partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined:  Data from advertising technologies on and off our Services, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and device identifiers; Member-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, title and industry); Data from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content you read, who you follow or is following you, connections,\\xa0groups\\xa0participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3; Information from advertising partners, vendors and\\xa0publishers; and Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; using graduation dates to infer age or using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender; using your feed activity to infer your interests; or using device data to recognize you as a Member).  We will show you ads called\\xa0sponsored content\\xa0which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as “ad” or “sponsored”). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your settings, if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services,\\xa0that action\\xa0may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown. Ad Choices We adhere to\\xa0self-regulatory principles\\xa0for interest-based advertising and participate in industry\\xa0opt-outs\\xa0from such ads. This does not opt you out of receiving advertising; you will continue to get other ads by advertisers not listed with these self regulatory tools. You can also\\xa0opt-out\\xa0specifically from our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. For Visitors, the setting is\\xa0here. Info to Ad Providers We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. In such instances, we seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so. 2.5 Marketing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe promote our Services to you and others.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services. 2.6 Developing Services and Research\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe develop our Services and conduct research\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nService Development We use data, including public feedback, to conduct\\xa0research\\xa0and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity. Other Research We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these\\xa0jobs\\xa0and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under\\xa0controls\\xa0that are designed to protect your privacy. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data. Surveys Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may\\xa0opt-out\\xa0of survey invitations. 2.7 Customer Support\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe use data to help you and fix problems.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for Service issues (e.g., bugs). 2.8 Insights That Do Not Identify You\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe use data to generate insights that do not identify you.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe use your data to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your\\xa0data\\xa0to generate statistics about our members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on, or to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights. 2.9 Security and Investigations\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe use data for security, fraud prevention and investigations.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of our\\xa0User Agreement\\xa0and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors or others.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          Key Terms\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSocial Action E.g.\\xa0like, comment, follow,\\xa0share\\xa0 Partners Partners include ad networks, exchanges and\\xa0others\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3. How We Share Information 3.1 Our Services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAny data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nProfile Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your\\xa0settings, it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third- party search engines). As detailed in our\\xa0Help Center, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their\\xa0usage of our Services, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.  When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your\\xa0settings). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a\\xa0group, posts are visible to others in the group. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your\\xa0settings. Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by it and others who visit those pages. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your\\xa0settings\\xa0where applicable. Subject to your\\xa0settings, we let a Member know when you view their profile. When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nEnterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of\\xa0Sales Navigator\\xa0will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your\\xa0settings, when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRegulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nSome Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nSubject to your\\xa0settings, other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may\\xa0revoke\\xa0the link with such accounts. Subject to your\\xa0settings, excerpts from your\\xa0profile\\xa0will appear on the services of others (e.g., search engine results, mail and calendar applications that show a user limited profile data of the person they are meeting or messaging,\\xa0social media aggregators, talent and lead managers). “Old” profile information remains on these services until they update their data cache with changes you made to your profile. 3.4 Related Services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe will share your personal data with our affiliates to provide and develop our Services. We may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe may use others to help us with our Services.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development). They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. 3.6 Legal Disclosures\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nIt is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our\\xa0Data Request Guidelines\\xa0and\\xa0Transparency Report. 3.7 Change in Control or Sale\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Your Choices & Obligations 4.1 Data Retention\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services.

How We Use Your Data\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe use your data to provide, support, personalize and develop our Services.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nHow we use your personal data will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your\\xa0settings. We use the data that we have about you to provide and personalize our Services, including with the help of automated systems and inferences we make, so that our Services (including ads) can be more relevant and useful to you and others. 2.1 Services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOur Services help you connect with others, find and be found for work and business opportunities, stay informed, get training and be more productive.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings. Stay Connected Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can “connect” with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to “connect” with you. Subject to your and their\\xa0settings, when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others’ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities. We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other\\xa0nearby\\xa0Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event). It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can\\xa0choose\\xa0whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections. Visitors have\\xa0choices\\xa0about how we use their data. Stay Informed Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your\\xa0settings, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a\\xa0social action, used a feature, made new connections or were\\xa0mentioned in the news. Career Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a\\xa0specific task) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs or mentees, show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are\\xa0interested\\xa0in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services. Productivity Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your\\xa0settings\\xa0allow, we scan messages to provide “bots” or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps.\\xa0Learn more. 2.2 Premium Services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOur premium Services help paying users to search for and contact Members through our Services, such as searching for and contacting job candidates, sales leads and co-workers, manage talent and promote content through social media.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe sell premium Services that provide our customers and subscribers with customized-search functionality and tools (including messaging and activity alerts) as part of our talent, marketing and sales solutions. Customers can export limited information from your profile, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and general location (e.g., Dublin), such as to manage sales leads or talent, unless you\\xa0opt-out. We do not provide contact information to customers as part of these premium Services without your consent. Premium Services customers can store information they have about you in our premium Services, such as a resume or contact information or sales history. The data stored about you by these customers is subject to the policies of those customers. Other enterprise Services and features that use your data include\\xa0TeamLink\\xa0and\\xa0Elevate\\xa0(social promotion of content). 2.3 Communications\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe contact you and enable communications between Members. We offer settings to control what messages you receive and how often you receive some types of messages.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also send messages about how to use our Services, network updates, reminders, job suggestions and promotional messages from us and our partners. You may change your communication\\xa0preferences\\xa0at any time. Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from us, including security and legal notices. We also enable\\xa0communications\\xa0between you and others through our Services, including for example\\xa0invitations,\\xa0InMail,\\xa0groups\\xa0and\\xa0messages\\xa0between connections. 2.4 Advertising\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe serve you tailored ads both on and off our Services. We offer you choices regarding personalized ads, but you cannot opt-out of seeing other ads.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of\\xa0partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined:  Data from advertising technologies on and off our Services, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and device identifiers; Member-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, title and industry); Data from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content you read, who you follow or is following you, connections,\\xa0groups\\xa0participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3; Information from advertising partners, vendors and\\xa0publishers; and Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; using graduation dates to infer age or using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender; using your feed activity to infer your interests; or using device data to recognize you as a Member).  We will show you ads called\\xa0sponsored content\\xa0which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as “ad” or “sponsored”). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your settings, if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services,\\xa0that action\\xa0may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown. Ad Choices We adhere to\\xa0self-regulatory principles\\xa0for interest-based advertising and participate in industry\\xa0opt-outs\\xa0from such ads. This does not opt you out of receiving advertising; you will continue to get other ads by advertisers not listed with these self regulatory tools. You can also\\xa0opt-out\\xa0specifically from our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. For Visitors, the setting is\\xa0here. Info to Ad Providers We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. In such instances, we seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so. 2.5 Marketing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe promote our Services to you and others.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services. 2.6 Developing Services and Research\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe develop our Services and conduct research\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nService Development We use data, including public feedback, to conduct\\xa0research\\xa0and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity. Other Research We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these\\xa0jobs\\xa0and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under\\xa0controls\\xa0that are designed to protect your privacy. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data. Surveys Polls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may\\xa0opt-out\\xa0of survey invitations. 2.7 Customer Support\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe use data to help you and fix problems.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for Service issues (e.g., bugs). 2.8 Insights That Do Not Identify You\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe use data to generate insights that do not identify you.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe use your data to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your\\xa0data\\xa0to generate statistics about our members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on, or to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights. 2.9 Security and Investigations\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe use data for security, fraud prevention and investigations.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of our\\xa0User Agreement\\xa0and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors or others.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          Key Terms\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSocial Action E.g.\\xa0like, comment, follow,\\xa0share\\xa0 Partners Partners include ad networks, exchanges and\\xa0others\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3. How We Share Information 3.1 Our Services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAny data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nProfile Your profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your\\xa0settings, it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third- party search engines). As detailed in our\\xa0Help Center, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their\\xa0usage of our Services, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.  When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your\\xa0settings). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one). In a\\xa0group, posts are visible to others in the group. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your\\xa0settings. Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by it and others who visit those pages. When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower. We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your\\xa0settings\\xa0where applicable. Subject to your\\xa0settings, we let a Member know when you view their profile. When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nEnterprise Accounts Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services. Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of\\xa0Sales Navigator\\xa0will be asked to share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services). Subject to your\\xa0settings, when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services. 3.2 Communication Archival\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRegulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nSome Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license. 3.3 Others’ Services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nSubject to your\\xa0settings, other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may\\xa0revoke\\xa0the link with such accounts. Subject to your\\xa0settings, excerpts from your\\xa0profile\\xa0will appear on the services of others (e.g., search engine results, mail and calendar applications that show a user limited profile data of the person they are meeting or messaging,\\xa0social media aggregators, talent and lead managers). “Old” profile information remains on these services until they update their data cache with changes you made to your profile. 3.4 Related Services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe will share your personal data with our affiliates to provide and develop our Services. We may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history. 3.5 Service Providers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe may use others to help us with our Services.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development). They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. 3.6 Legal Disclosures\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nIt is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our\\xa0Data Request Guidelines\\xa0and\\xa0Transparency Report. 3.7 Change in Control or Sale\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Your Choices & Obligations 4.1 Data Retention\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form. 4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can access or delete your personal data. You have many choices about how your data is collected, used and shared.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe provide many\\xa0choices\\xa0about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your\\xa0profile\\xa0and controlling the visibility of your\\xa0posts\\xa0to advertising\\xa0opt-outs\\xa0and\\xa0communication\\xa0controls. We offer you\\xa0settings\\xa0to control and manage the personal data we have about you. For personal data that we have about you, you can:  Delete Data:\\xa0You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data (e.g., if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you). Change or Correct Data: You can edit some of your personal data through your account. You can also ask us to change, update or fix your data in certain cases, particularly if it’s inaccurate. Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data:\\xa0You can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held). Right to Access and/or Take Your Data:\\xa0You can ask us for a copy of your personal data and can ask for a copy of personal data you provided in machine readable form.

Residents in the\\xa0Designated Countries\\xa0and\\xa0other regions\\xa0may have additional rights under their laws. 4.3 Account Closure\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe keep some of your data even after you close your account.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you choose to close your\\xa0LinkedIn\\xa0account, your personal data will generally stop being visible to others on our Services within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below. We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have\\xa0restricted\\xa0your account for breach of our\\xa0Professional Community Policies), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to \"unsubscribe\" from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed. Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search engine results) until they refresh their cache.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5. Other Important Information 5.1. Security\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe monitor for and try to prevent security breaches. Please use the security features available through our Services.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe implement security safeguards designed to protect your data, such as HTTPS. We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. However, we cannot warrant the security of any information that you send us. There is no guarantee that data may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. Please visit our\\xa0Safety Center\\xa0for additional information about safely using our Services, including\\xa0two-factor authentication. 5.2. Cross-Border Data Transfers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe store and use your data outside your country.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe process data both inside and outside of the United States and rely on legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders.\\xa0Learn more. Countries where we process data may have laws which are different from, and potentially not as protective as, the laws of your own country. 5.3 Lawful Bases for Processing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe have lawful bases to collect, use and share data about you. You have choices about our use of your data. At any time, you can withdraw consent you have provided by going to settings.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nWe will only collect and process personal data about you where we have lawful bases.

This Cookie Policy applies to any LinkedIn product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. We use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels, local storage and mobile ad IDs (collectively referred to in this policy as “cookies”) to collect and use data as part of our Services, as defined in our Privacy Policy (“Services”). What technologies are used?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          ENTER A SUMMARY\\n        \\n   Type of technology Description     Cookies  A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables LinkedIn features and functionality. Any browser visiting our sites may receive cookies from us or cookies from third parties such as our customers, partners or service providers. We or third parties may also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-LinkedIn sites that display ads or that host our plugins or tags. \\xa0 We use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie lasts beyond the current session and is used for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to LinkedIn and interact with our Services without signing in again. Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will be read by LinkedIn when you return to one of our sites or visit a third party site that uses our Services. Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).    Pixels A pixel is a tiny image that may be embedded within web pages and emails, requiring a call (which provides device and visit information) to our servers in order for the pixel to be rendered in those web pages and emails. We use pixels to learn more about your interactions with email content or web content, such as whether you interacted with ads or posts. Pixels can also enable us and third parties to place cookies on your browser.   Local storage Local storage enables a website or application to store information locally on your device(s). Local storage may be used to improve the LinkedIn experience, for example, by enabling features, remembering your preferences and speeding up site functionality.   Other similar technologies We also use other tracking technologies, such as mobile advertising IDs and tags for similar purposes as described in this Cookie Policy.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Our cookie tables list some of the cookies that are used by us and third parties as part of our Services. Please note that these tables may be updated from time to time to provide you with the latest information. What are these technologies used for?

We also use these technologies to remember information about your browser and your preferences. \\xa0    Functional  We use cookies to improve your experience on our Services.    Plugins on and off LinkedIn  We use cookies to enable LinkedIn plugins both on and off the LinkedIn sites. \\xa0 Our plugins may be found on LinkedIn or third-party sites, such as the sites of our customers and partners. If you interact with a plugin, the plugin will use cookies to identify you and initiate your request. \\xa0 You can learn more about plugins here. \\xa0    Personalized Advertising  Cookies help us show you relevant advertising, both on and off our Services and measure the performance of such ads and report on it. We use cookies to learn whether content has been shown to you or whether someone who was presented with an ad later came back and took an action (e.g., downloaded a white paper or made a purchase) on another site. Similarly, our partners or service providers may use cookies to determine whether we’ve shown an ad or a post and how it performed or provide us with information about how you interact with ads. \\xa0 We may also work with our customers and partners to show you an ad on or off LinkedIn, such as after you’ve visited a customer’s or partner’s site or application. \\xa0 For further information regarding the use of cookies for advertising purposes, please see Sections 1.4\\xa0and\\xa02.4\\xa0of the Privacy Policy.    Analytics and research  Cookies help us learn more about how well our Services and plugins perform in different locations. We or our service providers use cookies to understand, improve, and research products, features and services, including as you navigate through our sites or when you access LinkedIn from other sites, applications or devices. We or our service providers, use cookies to determine and measure the performance of ads or posts on and off LinkedIn and to learn whether you have interacted with our or our customers’ websites, content or emails and provide analytics based on those interactions. \\xa0 We also use cookies to provide aggregated information to our customers and partners as part of our Services. \\xa0 If you are a LinkedIn member but logged out of your account on a browser, LinkedIn may still continue to log your interaction with our Services on that browser for up to 30 days in order to generate usage analytics for our Services. We may share these analytics in aggregate form with our customers.    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n What third parties use these technologies in connection with our Services? Third parties such as our customers, partners and service providers may use cookies in connection with our Services. For example, third parties may use cookies in their LinkedIn pages, job posts and their advertisements on and off LinkedIn for their own marketing purposes. For an illustration, please visit\\xa0LinkedIn’s Help Center. Third parties may also use cookies in connection with our off-site Services, such as LinkedIn ad services. Third parties may use cookies to help us to provide our Services. We may also work with third parties for our own marketing purposes and to enable us to analyze and research our Services. Your Choices You have choices on how LinkedIn uses cookies. Please note that if you limit the ability of LinkedIn to use cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it may no longer be as personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information. Targeted Advertising As described\\xa0here, you have choices regarding the use of your personal data for targeted advertising. Some mobile device operating systems such as Android and iOS provide the ability to control the use of mobile advertising IDs for ads personalization. You can learn how to use these controls by visiting the manufacturer’s website for both Android and iOS. Browser Controls Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings, which may be adapted to reflect your consent to the use of cookies. Further, most browsers also enable you to review and erase cookies, including LinkedIn cookies. To learn more about browser controls, please consult the documentation that your browser manufacturer provides.

What is Do Not Track (DNT)? DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. As such, LinkedIn does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther helpful resources To learn more about advertisers’ use of cookies, please visit the following links:  Internet Advertising Bureau (US) European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EU) Internet Advertising Bureau (EU) \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\n© 2021\\n\\n\\n\\n            About\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n            Accessibility\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n            User Agreement\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n            Privacy Policy\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n            Cookie Policy\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n            Copyright Policy\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n            Brand Policy\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n            Guest Controls\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n            Community Guidelines\\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                العربية (Arabic)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Čeština (Czech)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Dansk (Danish)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Deutsch (German)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnglish (English)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Español (Spanish)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Français (French)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Bahasa Indonesia (Bahasa Indonesia)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Italiano (Italian)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                日本語 (Japanese)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                한국어 (Korean)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Bahasa Malaysia (Malay)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Nederlands (Dutch)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Norsk (Norwegian)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Polski (Polish)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Português (Portuguese)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Română (Romanian)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Русский (Russian)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Svenska (Swedish)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                ภาษาไทย (Thai)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Tagalog (Tagalog)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Türkçe (Turkish)\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                简体中文 (Chinese (Simplified))\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                正體中文 (Chinese (Traditional))\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\nLanguage\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n',\n",

You must maintain a minimum amount of space between the LinkedIn logo and other graphic or textual elements. To preserve the integrity and clarity of the logo, a standard area of “clear space” should be maintained around the logo in all uses. The minimum clear space is defined as “2x” where “x” is measured by the width of the type stroke of the letter “I” in the logo. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Required clear space for the LinkedIn logo  Logo and Background Color: The LinkedIn logo should always be used in color for online use. The LinkedIn logo should also be used in color for print applications unless the color version is not practical, in which case the logo can be reproduced in solid black. The preferred background color for the logo is solid white. When a solid white color is not practical, it may be used on a solid, light background color. The high resolution logo must be used for all print applications. High resolution logos can be downloaded here. If you are a member of the media and have any specific requirements, please contact us at trademark@linkedin.com.  Logo Size: The LinkedIn logos may be provided in different sizes/resolutions in transparent PNG format. To ensure the logo resolution and quality are not degraded, these logos may not be enlarged beyond their native/maximum size. Vector EPS logos may be enlarged beyond their native size. The minimum size is 21px tall on screen, or 0.25” tall (6.35mm) in print applications, measured by the height of the “in” box.  No Modification: The LinkedIn Marks must be used as provided by LinkedIn with no modifications. Don’t remove, distort or alter any element of the Marks, including changing any colors. Do not shorten, abbreviate, or create acronyms out of the Marks.  No Confusingly Similar Marks: Don’t use the Marks in a manner that might create potential confusion as to the owner of the LinkedIn Marks or imply that LinkedIn is the source of your products or services.  No Incorporation: Don’t incorporate the LinkedIn Marks into your own product name, service names, trademarks, logos, company names, domain names, website title, publication title, application icon, favicon, or the like. Don’t incorporate or use the IN logo as part of a word.  No Generic Use: Don’t use the LinkedIn Marks in a way that suggests a common, descriptive, or generic meaning.  No Plural or Possessive Use: Never use the LinkedIn Marks in the plural or possessive form.  Domain Names: Don’t register the LinkedIn Marks as domain names or as any part of a domain name.  Trade Dress: Don’t copy or imitate LinkedIn’s website design, typefaces, distinctive color, graphics designs or imagery.  Endorsement: Don’t display the LinkedIn Marks in any manner that might imply a relationship or affiliation with, sponsorship, or endorsement by LinkedIn, or that can be reasonably interpreted to suggest that any content has been authorized by or represents the views or opinions of LinkedIn or LinkedIn personnel.  Prominence: Don’t display the LinkedIn Marks as the primary or most prominent feature on your web page or in any non-LinkedIn materials.  Disparagement: Do not use the LinkedIn Marks in a manner that would disparage LinkedIn Corporation or its products or services.  Violation of Law: Don’t display the LinkedIn Marks on any web site that contains or displays adult content, promotes gambling, involves the sale of tobacco or alcohol to persons under twenty-one years of age, or otherwise violates any law or regulation.  Objectionable Use: Don’t display the LinkedIn Marks in a manner that is in LinkedIn’s sole opinion misleading, unfair, defamatory, infringing, libelous, disparaging, obscene or otherwise objectionable to LinkedIn.  Attribution: The LinkedIn Marks must be accompanied by the appropriate ® or ™ symbol. If you use the Marks outside the United States, please see Use Outside the US below.  Use Outside the US: Trademark rights vary from country to country. Some countries have penalties for improper use of the registration symbol ®. If using the Marks on sites based outside the United States, use the ™ symbol unless otherwise noted in these Guidelines.  Termination: LinkedIn may ask you to stop using the Marks at any time. You agree to stop using the Marks within a reasonable period of LinkedIn’s request, but in no situation, more than seven (7) days after LinkedIn’s request.  Reservation of Rights: LinkedIn is the owner of all rights in the Marks and reserves all rights save the limited license granted here. Your use of the Marks pursuant to this license shall not be construed as limiting any of LinkedIn’s rights in the Marks.
